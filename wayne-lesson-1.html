         <p>On one of those exciting occasions, during a contest for the Presidency of the United
            States, a number of gentlemen met in the city of Baltimore. They were few in number,
            and appeared little concerned about the affairs of the general government. Though
            men of intelligence, their time and attention 
            
            seemed
            appeared
             to be entirely absorbed in an adventure of self interest. They met for the purpose
            of completing arrangements for refitting the old ship 'Merchantman,' which then lay
            in the harbor near Fell's Point. Colonel Stephen Franks, Major James Armsted, Captain
            Richard Paul and Captain George 
            
            Rayer
            Royer
             , composed those who represented the American sideâ€”Captain Juan Garcia and Captain
            Jose Castello, those of Cuban interest.
            Here a conversation ensued upon what seemed a point of vital importance to the company;
            it related to the place best suited for the completion of their arrangements. The
            Americans insisted on Baltimore as affording the greatest facilities, and having done
            more for the encouragement and protection of the trade, than any other known place.
            Whilst the Cubans on the other side, urged their objections on the ground that the
            continual increase of liberal principles in the various political parties, which were
            fast ushering into existence, made the objection beyond a controversy. Havana was
            contended for as a point best suited for adjusting their arrangements, and that too
            with many apparent reasons; but for some cause, the preference for Baltimore prevailed.
            Subsequently to the adjustment of their affairs by the most complete arrangement for
            refitting the vessel, Col. Franks took leave of the party for his home in the distant
            State of Mississippi.
